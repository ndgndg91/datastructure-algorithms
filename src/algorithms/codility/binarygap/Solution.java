// A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros
// that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.
//
// For example, number 9 has binary representation 1001 and contains a binary gap of length 2.
// The number 529 has binary representation 1000010001 and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3.
// The number 20 has binary representation 10100 and contains one binary gap of length 1.
// The number 15 has binary representation 1111 and has no binary gaps.
// The number 32 has binary representation 100000 and has no binary gaps.
//
// Write a function:
//
// class Solution { public int solution(int N); }
//
// that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap.
// The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.
//
// For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5,
// because N has binary representation 10000010001 and so its longest binary gap is of length 5.
// Given N = 32 the function should return 0, because N has binary representation '100000' and thus no binary gaps.
//
// Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
//
// N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].
